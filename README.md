Francesco is well-known high-end Italian restaurant in Montreal. It has more than a half century history which was started as a small family restaurant with homemade food. Today Francesco is a brand that represents fidelity to traditions, ultimate quality, exclusivity and highest privacy.

This site was designed and created from scratch according to client's creative brief. 

The project is done by using SASS preprocessor for CSS code, jQuery library for animations, jQuery UI for styling form inputs.

Back-end part is written in PHP and contains simple controller for rendering pages and a couple of functions for getting content (images names and menu items names) from files.
